            Removing Expiration Notices from Internet-Drafts
               draft-thomson-gendispatch-no-expiry-latest

Abstract

   The long-standing policy of requiring that Internet-Drafts bear an
   expiration date is no longer necessary.  This document removes
   requirements for expiration for Internet-Drafts from RFC 2026/BCP 9
   and RFC 2418/BCP 25.  In place of expiration, this document
   introduces Internet-Drafts being labeled "active" and "inactive" in
   the IETF tooling.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at https://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on 7 July 2024.

1.  Introduction

   The Content Guidelines for Internet Drafts [IDCG] requires that
   Internet-Drafts include an expiration statement.  Tooling and IETF
   practice insist on Internet-Drafts including an expiry date 185 days
   after their posting.  After this expiration date, some systems might
   display an Internet-Draft differently or not at all, with some
   exceptions, such as when the document is under IESG review.

   Expiration is believed to prevent the use of an Internet-Draft for
   reference purposes, so that they do not become stable references in
   other work.  Expiration also existed to encourage authors to update
   drafts that they wish to discuss.  Originally, expired drafts were
   deleted from IETF servers completely; more recently, expiration only
   caused the document to be hidden from certain views or searches.

   Copies of expired drafts are retained and can be obtained using other
   services.  Expired drafts are routinely cited and referenced.
   Published RFCs routinely include informative references to drafts,
   which then usually expire.  Many IANA registries refer to expired
   drafts.  Thus, statements about it being inappropriate to cite drafts
   are incorrect and can lead readers not familiar with IETF processes
   to misunderstand how old drafts are actually used.

   This document does the following:

   *  Updates [STD-PROCESS] to eliminate the removal of an Internet-
      Draft when the latest version is unchanged for more than six
      months.

   *  Updates [WG] to eliminate the inclusion of an expiration date in
      Internet-Drafts.

   *  Updates the boilerplate text for Internet-Drafts to no longer
      include the "Expires:" field.

   *  Introduces a status for Internet-Drafts which can be set to either
      "active" or "inactive" in tooling without specifying how this is
      implemented.

2.  Removing Internet-Draft Expiration

   Forced expiration serves no purpose that is not adequately served by
   the publication date on the document.

   The date of posting for an Internet-Draft is the best -- or perhaps
   only -- information available that can be added to a document the
   time of publication that might help readers understand whether the
   content is valid.  Future events might invalidate the content
   virtually immediately; conversely, an Internet-Draft could also
   remain relevant for an arbitrarily long period of time.

   This document proposes that the "Expires:" field be removed from the
   header of submitted Internet-Drafts, and that the boilerplate be
   amended as follows:

   OLD:

      Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
      months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
      documents at any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts
      as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in
      progress."

   NEW:

      Internet-Drafts are draft documents that may be updated, replaced,
      or obsoleted at any time.  It is inappropriate to cite them other
      than as "work in progress."

   Creating a revision to the Content Guidelines [IDCG] will be
   necessary to remove references to expiration.

   This document updates RFC 2026 [STD-PROCESS] to remove the second
   paragraph of Section 2.2 and RFC 2418 [WG] to remove a single mention
   of expiration from Section 7.2.

   Other than these specific changes, both RFC 2026 and RFC 2418 refer
   to expiration of drafts.  With this change, this is understood to
   apply to drafts that are marked as "dead" in tooling.

3.  Replacement Procedures

   The expiration of a draft is intended to ensure that the topic is
   disqualified from consideration and discussion.  At the same time,
   updating a draft indicates continued interest from the authors.

   People might choose to concentrate their efforts on drafts that have
   been recently updated.  For instance, when setting an agenda for a
   session, chairs might give precedence to documents that have been
   updated since the preceding session.

   Expiration has also been used as a reminder to authors to update
   documents.  A substitute for expiration reminders might be to provide
   a note in advance of planned sessions.  For instance, for an upcoming
   session N+1, a reminder might be issued for drafts that have not been
   updated in the interval between session N and session N+1, but were
   updated between session N-1 and session N.

4.  Referencing Internet-Drafts

   Documents referencing Internet-Drafts should always include the two-
   digit version number of the draft.  It is possible to reference the
   latest version of a draft by excluding the two-digit version number,
   but this can lead readers of the reference to not know which version
   of the draft is being referenced.  Documents referencing Internet-
   Drafts should always reference using URLs for the IETF Datatracker
   because this is expected to be the most stable URL for a particular
   version of a draft.

5.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   This document has no direct implications on security or privacy.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
