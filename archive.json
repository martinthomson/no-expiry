In that scenario, I don't include the two-digit draft number - though it is added by the tooling. That's made life much better than the days of XML editing where the draft number needed to be edited manually every time idnits complained. So, is this guidance for tool authors?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we might want to be clearer about what \"URLs for the IETF Datatracker\" means - the tooling currently links to the [HTMLized version from the datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-thomson-gendispatch-no-expiry-02) but you could imagine linking instead to the [status page of this version of the draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thomson-gendispatch-no-expiry/02/), or perhaps the [HTML version from the archive](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-thomson-gendispatch-no-expiry-02.html).",
